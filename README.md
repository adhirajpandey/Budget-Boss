## Working
User inputs the desired product link and email. This data along with Product Title and it's Current Price is added in the database.

The background listener.py file runs every hour and compares the current price of the product with the saved price. If the current price is less than the saved price, the bot sends a mail to the user with the required details as shown in the sample below. This listener script is scheduled using cronjob.

To facilitate Deals Functionality, extract_deals.py gets most recent deals messages from telegram channel and saves them in MongoDB collection and fetch_images.py extracts images from saved deals links. Both of these scripts are scheduled using Airflow in form of DAG.

Edit: To bypass 15 mins sleep timeout by Azure, `wakewebsite.sh` script is also scheduled using cron to ping webapp at regular intervals.
